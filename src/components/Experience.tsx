    description: `My first taste of professional development! Got to work with the MERN stack and build stuff that users would interact with. 
    The highlight? Building a real-time dashboard that boosted user engagement by 40% (yeah, I was pretty proud of that). 
    Also learned why responsive design matters - nothing humbles you like seeing your desktop app look terrible on mobile.`,

    Been guiding junior developers through their coding journey, teaching them DSA concepts and helping them build their first projects (pretty rewarding stuff).
