              Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm <span className="text-blue-600 font-semibold">Deepak Modi</span>,
              a final-year B.Tech Computer Science Engineering student passionate about building full-stack web applications that solve real-world problems.
              I've created projects like NotesNeo for study notes, NeoCode for coding practice, and NeoCompiler for online code editing.
              With skills in React, Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, and Java, I love exploring new technologies, solving DSA problems on LeetCode, and working on AI-powered solutions.
